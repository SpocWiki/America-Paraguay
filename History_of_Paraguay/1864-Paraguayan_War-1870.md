> The Paraguayan War (Spanish: Guerra del Paraguay, Portuguese: Guerra do Paraguai, 
> Guarani: Paraguái Ñorairõ), also known as the War of the Triple Alliance 
> (Spanish: Guerra de la Triple Alianza, Portuguese: Guerra da Tríplice Aliança, 
> Guarani: Ñorairõ Triple Alianza Rehegua), was a South American war 
> that lasted from 1864 to 1870. 
> 
> It was fought between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina, 
> the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. 
> It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history. 
> Paraguay sustained large casualties, but even the approximate numbers are disputed. 
> Paraguay was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil. 
> The war began in late 1864, as a result of a conflict between Paraguay and Brazil 
> caused by the Uruguayan War. 
> Argentina and Uruguay entered the war against Paraguay in 1865, 
> and it then became known as the "War of the Triple Alliance".
>
> After Paraguay was defeated in conventional warfare, 
> it conducted a drawn-out guerrilla resistance, 
> a strategy that resulted in the further destruction of the Paraguayan military 
> and the civilian population. 
> 
> Much of the civilian population died due to battle, hunger, and disease. 
> The guerrilla war lasted for 14 months 
> until president Francisco Solano López was killed in action by Brazilian forces 
> in the Battle of Cerro Corá on 1 March 1870. 
> Argentine and Brazilian troops occupied Paraguay until 1876.
