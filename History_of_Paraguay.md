> The history of Paraguay encompasses thousands of years of human habitation.  
> Both agricultural and nomadic Guaycuruan lived in the region at the time of the Spanish Conquest. 
> 
> It became a relatively neglected part of the Spanish Empire 
> due to its isolation and lack of mineral wealth, 
> nonetheless a small group of Spanish settlers came to reside in the area, 
> increasingly intermarrying with native women to produce a mestizo population. 
> 
> In the 17th and 18th centuries, Jesuit missionaries organized the natives into planned communities 
> known as reducciones, and the experiment gained notable attention in Enlightenment Era Europe.
>
> In the early nineteenth century, Paraguay participated in the uprisings 
> across the Spanish Empire against Spanish rule, and newly independent Paraguay 
> came under the domination of Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, 
> who in his absolute rule almost entirely cut off the new nation from the world. 
> 
> After Dr. Francia's death in 1840, 
> Paraguay eventually came under the rule of Francisco Solano Lopez in 1862, 
> who proceeded to embroil the nation in a war against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay 
> which culminated in a Paraguayan defeat with massive population and territorial losses.
>
> Military rule continued into the 20th century, 
> which in the 1930s also saw Paraguay embroil itself in the Chaco War with Bolivia, 
> which ended in a Paraguayan victory. 
> 
> General Alfredo Stroessner came to power in 1954, and military rule continued until 1989 
> upon which the nation moved toward a multi party democracy 
> with a new constitution adopted in 1992.  
> 
> Paraguay in the 21st century has largely avoided the political strife 
> and strong-man rule that characterizes much of its history. 
> 
> The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Paraguay a "hybrid regime" in 2022.
